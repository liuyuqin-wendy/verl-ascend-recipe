"""Decorator-based patch primitives.

rollout_elastic extends verl by *decorating* native classes/methods at import
time instead of shipping modified copies of verl sources or `.patch` files.
Three primitives are provided:

- ``@patch(Cls, "method")``: replace ``Cls.method`` with the decorated function.
  The original implementation is preserved as ``Cls._orig_method``.
- ``@add(Cls, "method")``: attach a brand-new method to ``Cls`` (only if the
  native class does not already define it). This is how new methods that belong
  to a native class are kept in the recipe.
- ``@wrap(Cls, "method")``: wrap ``Cls.method`` so the decorated function
  receives the original implementation as its first argument.

All patchers are idempotent: a method that has already been patched (its
``_orig_<name>`` slot exists) is left untouched on re-import.

``@ray.remote``-decorated classes are handled transparently: the decorators
unwrap ``ActorClass`` to its ``__ray_actor_class__`` before patching, so the
same call site works for plain and Ray-actor classes.
